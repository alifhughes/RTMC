## v0.9.1
  + Hotfix: Actually include `dist` directory when downloading v0.9.x

## v0.9.0
+ (Re)Upgrade to Babel v6!
+ Integrate `fly-util` module directly into core.
+ Import `fly-util`'s tests.
+ Revert `bin` to spawn native `child_process`. Includes `babel-polyfill` to avoid babel issues.

## v0.8.8
+ Add ability to _flatten_ target files. Provides an optional `depth` option to `.target()`. See [documentation](https://github.com/bucaran/fly/blob/master/docs/README.md#depths) for more.

## v0.8.6
+ Remove automatic sourcemaps. They behaved inconsistently and were not a part of the intended core functionality.

## v0.8.5
+ Reverted to Babel v5 (temporarily)
+ Use `babel-node` at `bin` runtime.

## v0.8.0

+ :boom: Rewrite tests in ES6.

+ :boom: Add test coverage tools. [#71](https://github.com/flyjs/fly/issues/71)

+ :boom: Better error handling.
  + Throw a descriptive error when plugins are not found inside `node_modules`
  + Show name of file when plugin fails. SEE [#85](https://github.com/flyjs/fly/issues/85)/[@andy-hanson](https://github.com/andy-hanson), [#93](https://github.com/flyjs/fly/issues/93) and [#94](https://github.com/flyjs/fly/issues/94).

+ Improve usage of npm scripts, more closely resembling those found in [generator-rise](https://github.com/bucaran/generator-rise).

+ Support passing `data, options, ...rest` to support a variable number of arguments inside filters/plugins:

  ```js
  //flyfile.js
  yield this.source(...).myPlugin(a, b, c).target(...)
  ```
  ```js
  // myPlugin/index.js
  module.exports = function (_) {
    this.filter("myPlugin", (data, a, b, c) => {
    })
  }
  ```

## v0.7.0

+ Objects that return objects with transformed data support any of the following forms:

```js
{ css, map, ext }
// or
{ js, map, ext }
// or
{ code, map, ext }
// or
{ data, map, ext }
```

## v0.7.0

+ :trophy: Handle sourcemaps [#60](https://github.com/flyjs/fly/issues/60)

+ :boom: In order to support sourcemaps and open the door to future features, transformer plugins using the `Fly.prototype.filter` method can now return an object instead of a string such as:

  > See [#83](https://github.com/flyjs/fly/issues/83)

  ```js
  return {
    code: "data",
    map: {/* source map */},
    ext: ".js"
  }
  ```

+ :boom: Improve plugin API. Plugins injecting filters are not required to create `try { } catch() {}` blocks anymore.


+ :warning: Deprecate `Fly.prototype.write` in favor of promoting writing your own plugins that perform IO.

+ :boom: Make `Fly.prototype._filters` publish by renaming it to `Fly.prototype.filters`.

  > Please use `Fly.prototype.filter` to add inline transformers, create plugins, etc. But don't be afraid of using this collection if you are in dire need.

+ :boom: Refactor `fly.js`, remove duplication from `concat` and `target`

+ :space_invader: Improve instrumentation for plugins and filters.

+ :space_invader: Fix [clor](https://github.com/bucaran/clor) overriding `Function.prototype.name` inadvertently in [#79](https://github.com/flyjs/fly/issues/79)

## v0.6.0

+ Improve build workflow by removing `dist` from repository and using `npm prepublish` step to compile Fly.

+ :boom: :boom: Fix encoding bug that was corrupting non-text files. Now Fly can read/filter/write any type of files, but there is a minor caveat:

> Now filters and plugins, will receive the **raw data** as opposed to a _string_. This means if the filter/plugin is expecting a string, (for example `fly-coffescript` expects the source code to compile as a string) you need to convert the data to a string _before_ you can call any `String.prototype` methods on it.

  For example:

  ```js
  export default function* () {
    yield this
      .source("words.txt")
      .filter((data) => `${data}\n`)
      .target("dist")
  }
  ```

  or


  ```js
  export default function* () {
    yield this
      .source("words.txt")
      .filter((data) => data.toString() + "\n")
      .target("dist")
  }
  ```

  > Documentation, examples and existing plugins have been updated.


+ :boom: Following up on the above mentioned fix, `Fly.proto.encoding` has been deprecated starting from this `@0.6.0`.

## v0.5.0

+ :boom: Fix Fly's own `flyfile.js` to compile with fly. If you have fly installed globally just type `fly` to compile fly, otherwise type `bin/index`. For full instrumentation type: `DEBUG="fly*" fly` or `env DEBUG="fly*" fly`.

+ :boom: Upgrade to [`parsec@1.3.0`](https://github.com/bucaran/parsec/blob/master/src/index.js) that featured a complete rewrite and several improvements.

+ :boom: Fix bug where plugin closures created by `Fly.proto.filter` where bound to the fly instance `.filter` instead of the Fly instance that would exist during concurrent execution.

  > Loading plugins (invoking each plugin's default export function) occurs only once during Fly's instantiation by the CLI. Some plugins may inject dependencies directly into the Fly instance or use `Fly.proto.filter` at this time. Before, `.filter` would create a closure by means of an arrow function bound to the new Fly instance. This would break concurrent tasks using `fly-*` plugins as described by [#73](https://github.com/flyjs/fly/issues/73).

  > Each task running in parallel is invoked bound to a copy of the Fly instance which is obtained via `Object.create(fly)`. This fix does not bind the closure created in `.filter` to any object, thus the correct `this` reference to any Fly instance is always picked up.

+ Fix encoding issue during `.source` â†’ `.target` simple file copies of non-text files. Fixes [#72](https://github.com/flyjs/fly/issues/72)

+ Fix bug in `Fly.proto.target` where target directory name was not specified, and only the new file name was used to copy to _target_. The result was each `.target` write operation would create a flat tree skipping subdirectories and writing everything to the _target_ directory.

+ Improve `Fly.proto.target` with more instrumentation and simplify recursive reduce filter.

+ Improve multi tasking examples under `examples/multi`.

+ Review examples directory and refactor inconsistencies.


## v0.4.0

+ :boom: **new** in addition to Flyfiles, plugins can now be written in *ES6/7* out of the box. To accomplish this, node's `require` is bound using `babel-core/register` before loading plugins.

  > Support for plugins written in any language is under discussion.

+ :boom: **new** Flyfiles are transpiled by default with Babel. This adds a small perf penalty when running a modified flyfile the first time, but will allow us to support more versions of node in the future.

+ :boom: **new** full tests! Check out `test/`.

+ :boom: **new** instrumentation  :flashlight: Set `DEBUG="*"` or `DEBUG="fly:*"` for extensive logs. See [`debug`](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug)'s documentation for advance use.

+ :boom: **new** [Optional] plugins are now invoked with a contextualized `debug` object that can be used to add instrumentation to your plugin. `this.debug` is also available, useful to debug tasks in a flyfile.

```js
export default function (debug) {
  debug("init")
  //
  debug("finish")
}
```

> You are not required to instrument your plugins, but now it's very easy to do so and your users will appreciate the effort you put in making your code easier to debug.

+ **new** `examples/watch` to illustrate a watch task.

+ **improve** tests are now written in a mix of ES5 and ES6. if you are hacking on Fly and want to run the tests yourself, you need to run `iojs`. Check out [`n`](https://github.com/tj/n) for an excellent version manager for node.

+ **improve** revise documentation, fix typos, simplify and add more examples.

+ **improve** more concise comments, simplify CLI engine.

+ **improve** simpler and friendlier shell runner `bin/index`. Full Windows support is just around the corner.

+ **improve** errors are handled in `index.js` now (they were at `bin/index` before).

+ **improve** `index.js` is much simpler now. a new `Fly` instance is created via `cli.spawn` which hides the complexity of resolving the path and `cli.list` does not accept a path anymore, but a loaded `flyfile` object.

+ **change** `Flypath.js` is **no** longer a valid name for a Flyfile. Please , name your Flyfiles either `flyfile.js` or `Flyfile.js`.

+ **bugfix** `Fly.prototype.watch` was failing due to `fly-util` `watch` not being correctly exported and not calling `flatten` on the specified globs.

+ **change** fix an inconsistency where a `default` task with a watch would end *before* any tasks ran inside. This bug was resolved by returning a promise.

> **This affects `watch` tasks in your Flyfile.** Please `yield` watch tasks from now:

```js
export default function* () {
  yield this.watch(globs, tasks)
}
```

+ **change** `Fly.prototype.warn` was renamed to the more accurate `alert`.



## v0.3.4

+ New: Update to new logo:

  <img width=50px  src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8317250/8733685/0be81080-2c40-11e5-98d2-c634f076ccd7.png">
</a>
</span>

+ Change: Use `--list=bare` to display tasks without using terminal styles instead of `--list=simple`.

+ New: add `.codeclimate.yml`

+ Bugfix: `spawn.js` was yielding a non yieldable expression causing fears to be eaten out by darkness.

+ Improve: Documentation greatly revised and some parts rewritten :heart:

+ Bugfix: `bin/index.js` was not correctly loading `fly-util` causing some runtime errors to crash Fly silently.

+ New: Reporter displays ms/sec appropriately. [#33](https://github.com/flyjs/fly/issues/33).


## v0.3.2

+ Bugifx: New error handling was supressing the `No Flyfile found...` message.

## v0.3.1

+ Bugfix: `package.json` was exporting `bin/index`, but it should have been `bin/index.js`

## v0.3.0

+ Refactor: `fly.js` largely **rewritten**. Sharper code, cleaner syntax, don't overuse recursive reducers. 5~10% less LOC.

+ Bugifx: ES7 using `async/await` now works as expected.

+ Bugfix: `cli/spawn.js` was crashing if no plugins were found inside `node_modules`.

+ Improve: Better error handling and stack tracing across Fly. No more _silent_ crashes.

+ Update: `reporter.js` and `fmt.js` to latest `fly-util`

+ Remove: `Flyfile.js` from root and use `Flyfile.babel.js` instead.

+ Improve: Documentation and code comments.

### Multitasking

+ Run tasks in parallel via `Fly.prototype.run([tasks], { parallel: true })`.

  Imagine you have 10 functions that implement an asynchronous transformation on a data source, each taking about 1 minute to complete. Assume these functions are truly async by relying on native extensions or Node's IO API.

  Assign each transform to a different task. If you run all tasks sequentially you will have to wait at least 10 minutes. If you run all tasks in parallel you will have to wait at least 1 minute.

  + See `examples/multi` for examples.

### New Examples

+ Examples are now organized in directories by category, such as `multi`, `async`, `maps`, `css`, `lint`, etc. Each directory contains one or more Flyfiles describing related tasks. To run the examples, install its dependencies first using _Fly_:

  ```
  fly -f examples/
  ```

  See [examples/README](https://github.com/flyjs/fly/blob/master/examples/README.md).


## v0.2.0

### Async Transformers

+ This version introduces direct API support to work with async transformers. For example, if you have a filter such as `myFilter(source, cb)`, where `cb` is a callback run by `myFilter` when it's finished transforming the source, you can plug this functionality into Fly as follows:

```js
this.filter("myPlugin", (source, options) => {
  return this.defer(myFilter).call(this, source, options)
  //orâ†’ return this.defer(myFilter)(source, options)
})
```

If you need more advanced error handling you can return a promise yourself:

```js
this.filter("myPlugin", function (source, options) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    myFilter(source, function (data, error) {
      // advanced error handling
      else resolve(data)
    })
  })
})
```

Before this landed only sync transformers were supported by plugins.

+ Now plugins can specify the file extension transformed files should have.

```js
this.filter("myFilter", (source, options) => {}, {
  extension: ".html"
})
```

+ Fix a bug in the `npm` scripts that was causing the build to fail due to the tests not being able to find the `dist/` directory. Now `npm run build` only compiles the project.

+ Default tasks named `main` will no longer work as the _default_ task, please rename to `default` or export a default task.

ES5
```js
module.exports = function* () { ... }
```

ES6~
```js
export default function* () { ... }
```

+ We are now back to using `co` at the CLI bootstraper `bin/index.js` and having `src/index.js` simply export a generator.

## v0.1.10

+ Bump interpret version with correct support for Earl Grey.

## v0.1.10

+ Bugfix: Same bug as [v0.1.8](#v018), but this is correctly fixed by adding `babel-core` to dependencies. `babel` is still kept in `devDependencies` as you will need it to compile Fly during development.

+ Fix links in `CHANGELOG.md` versions.

## v0.1.9

+ Improve deploy script to add pushing to the origin as well.

## v0.1.8

+ Bugfix: Fly was not correctly transpiling ES6/ES7 Flyfiles using the `export` keyword in new installations. The cause was the npm build script was missing the  `--modules common` flag.

+ Add deploy script to `package.json` to simplify publishing to the registry. Make sure to bump Fly's version (`npm version *.*.*`) before running `npm run deploy`.

## v0.1.7

+ __Important__: Default tasks named as `main` will be __deprecated__ in `0.2.0`. Please update your code accordingly. (This "feature" was originally introduced in `v0.1.0`)

### Cascading Tasks
> Inpired by Koa.js [cascading middleware](http://koajs.com/#cascading).

+ Now it's possible to return a value from a task and receive it in the task executing right after. This opens the door to other ways for tasks to interact with each other.

This change is possible without breaking the API and easily by making `Fly.prototype.start([tasks])` return a promise. Up until now `start` was used in by the CLI engine in `/index.js` and by `Fly.prototype.watch()` to run tasks without checking on the return value.

This change also fixes a bug that was causing the reporter to incorrectly display the `default` task as _finished_ before time sometimes.

Basically it works as follows:

```js
export function* first () {
  return { secret: 42 }
}

export function* second ({ secret }) {
  this.log(`The secret is ${secret}`)
}

export default function* () {
  yield this.start(["first", "second"])
}
```

See `examples/Flyfile-Start.babel.js`.


+ Code refactoring and comments improvement in `fly.js`, `index.js`, `util.js`
  + The `co`-routine used in the CLI is no longer required in `bin/index.js` and this it is now encapsulated in `index.js`

+ Now `util` just exports `console.log.bind(console)` and `console.error.bind(console)`, this may change in the future if Fly needs to provide a different low level logging mechanism.

+ Updated documentation in English and æ—¥æœ¬èªž.

+ Earl Gray's dependencies were removed. Please `npm i earlgrey earlgrey-runtime` if you are writing Flyfiles in [Earl Gray](https://github.com/breuleux/earl-grey).

## v0.1.6

+ Fly now uses your module _actual_ default export as its `default` task. Before you needed to name your task `default` explicitly which is fine the CommonJS syntax:

```js
exports.default = function* () {}
```

But was problematic in the ES6~ syntax since `default` is a reserved word in JavaScript. Now it's _also_ possible to do:

```js
module.exports = function* () {}
```

Which is specially useful if you write your Flyfiles in the ES6/7 syntax:

```js
export default function* () {}
```

## v0.1.5

+ Fix bug in `util.error`, where function's argument `error` was shadowing function name `error`. :feelsgood:

+ Fix bug in `util.find/hook` that was still breaking the require hook for some type of files. Basically the problem is `jsVariant` either exposes an array with dependencies that should be loaded or a string. In the case of arrays its contents could be strings or object literals with a `module` property. The following check patches this:

```js
require(modules[0].module
  ? modules[0].module
  : modules[0])
```

> Note to Earl Gray users: `interpret@0.6.2` does not support earl at the moment. Please refer to [this PR](https://github.com/tkellen/js-interpret/pull/31). Make sure to install both `earlgray` and `earlgray-runtime` if you are using `Flyfile.eg` files. See `examples/Flyfile.eg` for an Earl Gray Flyfile example.

## v0.1.4

+ Fix bug in `util.find/hook` where jsVariants that expose the transformer module name using an array without a `module` property was being called causing Flyfiles in languages other than ES5/6/7 to fail.

## v0.1.3

+ Revise CLI engine, minor refactoring.

+ Fixed critical bug in `util.plugins` where CLI engine was failing to load if there were no listed plugins.

## v0.1.2

+ Bug fix: Rename `main` in `package.json` from `dist/index` to `dist/index.json`.

## v0.1.1

+ Now Fly uses Fly to build itself. See `Flyfile.babel.js` at the root of the proejct.

+ Improved error tracing.

  > This should be useful during development. In the future advanced error tracing should be configurable via `process.env.DEVELOPMENT `.

  <img width=600px src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8317250/8506916/db8b2eaa-2266-11e5-8395-74ba0c63da24.png">

+ Add consistent support for multiple Node versions.

+ Support Flyfile, flyfile, Flypath and flypath mapped to all the available `jsVariant` [extensions](https://github.com/tkellen/js-interpret#extensions) by default when you run `fly` on the command line.

Before you had to use `fly -f path/to/file` in order to run a specific Flyfile. You can still use `-f`, but _now_ Fly will automatically attempt to load Flyfiles based in the extension autoamtically.

+ Improve handling of globs by allowing nested arrays (See `util.flatten`).

+ Improve documentation and revise CONTRIBUTING.md

## v0.1.0

+ ### Multi-Flyfile Support
  Fly now supports Flyfiles written in other languages that can compile to JavaScript. CoffeeScript, TypeScript, ES6, ES7, etc. Examples are provided in the `examples/` directory. ES6 and ES7 is supported out of the box. For other languages you must make sure to install the corresponding `transformer` module. See [here](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS).

  While `exports.default = function* () { ... }` is valid JavaScript, `export function* default () { ... }` will cause a runtime error. Therefore, an alias was added to `default`, now you can write your default task as `main`:

  ```js
  export async function main () {
    await this.clear("dist")
    this.watch(paths, tasks)
  }
  ```

+ ### Plugins API update
  A simple transform plugin _before_:

  ```js
  module.exports = function () {
    this.myPlugin = function (opts) {
      return this.filter((src) => require("...")(src, opts))
    }
  }
  ```

  As discussed in [#6](https://github.com/flyjs/fly/issues/6) and chat rooms the previous style has some of the following disadvantages:

  + More verbose.
  + Difficult to check whether filter already exist or not.
  + Difficult to control report notifications from inside Fly.

  _Now_:
  ```js
  module.exports = function () {
    this.filter("myPlugin", (src, opts) => require("..")(src, opts))
  }
  ```

  This new plugin style is highly encouraged.

+ ### `watch` API update

  _Before_, one would create a `default` task and invoke `watch` at the end of the function, but this would cause an circular dependency issue.

  The problem was resolved making the assumption the user would never modify its globs, so `watch` was acting essentially like a singleton-like at a class instance level in order to prevent calling `watch` again, so in fact `watch` was only called once.

  _Now_, one still creates a `default` or `watch` task and the `Fly.prototype.watch` method only registers the watch observers and triggers the first round of tasks specified as the second array argument.

  The following causes the specified `tasks` to be executed immediately.

  ```js
  exports.default = function* () {
    // yield ...
    this.watch([globs], [tasks])
  }
  ```

  A more contrived example:

  ```js
  exports.default = function* () {
    this.watch(
      ["babel/src/*.js", "map/src/*", "coffee/src/**/*.coffee"],
      ["lint", "test", "clear", "grind", "map", "babel"])
  }
  ```

+ Fixed bug in `util.plugins` where reduce was not setting the initial value correctly. Thanks to [jigsaw](https://github.com/e-jigsaw).

## v0.0.1

+ Fly initial commit.

+ Commits between `0.0.1` and `0.0.4` consisted of adding comments, creating the CHANGELOG, adding examples, and other refactorings. Refer to [this issue](https://github.com/flyjs/fly/issues/12) regarding the jump from `0.5.0` to `0.1.0`.
